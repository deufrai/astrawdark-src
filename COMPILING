AstRawDark compiling instructions :
===================================

1)  Dependencies :
==================

    AstRawDark depends on the libexiv2 C++ library.

    a) GNU/Linux : libexiv2, runtime and dev, packages are available in
                   evry good distro

    b) Windows & OSX : See http://dev.exiv2.org/projects/exiv2/wiki/How_do_I_build_Exiv2_on_the_XYZ_platform
                       for instructions about building & installing libexiv2


2)  Building astrawdark :
=========================

    AstRawDark is written in C++ and uses the Qt Framework (Version 5)

    a) GNU/Linux : All you need is probably already available as packaged
                   tools for your distro. you'll need qt5-default, g++ & make packages

    b) Windows & OSX : The simplest way to build astrawdark would be to get QtCreator along with a
                       full opensource Qt5 stack.
